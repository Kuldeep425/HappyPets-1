# Happy Pets

Pet abandonment is a significant issue throughout the world and we witness many pets become homeless, roaming on the streets, especially in India. Owners leaving their pets just like that not only creates problems for society but is, simply, animal cruelty. One of the reasons for this issue is the non-availability of a platform that can help pet owners find potential adopters at the right time. Thus, we have created a Java mobile application, which will provide a seamless interface for adopting as well as finding new owners for these pets.

## Tech Stack
- JAVA
- XML
- Spring Boot
- MongoDB

## Features

- Create forms where pet owners can input information about their pets, including type, breed, color, age, and description. Allow them to upload images. Implement functionality to edit and delete pet entries.
- Create a messaging interface where pet owners and potential adopters can communicate in real-time. Implement a user-friendly chat window with message history, typing indicators, and delivery/read receipts.
- Design a search interface where adopters can input criteria such as type, breed, color, age, and more. Offer filter options to refine search results. Display search results with images and relevant information
